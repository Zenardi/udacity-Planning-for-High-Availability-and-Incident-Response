Warning: Reference to undefined provider

  on main.tf line 41, in module "vpc_west":
  41:     aws = aws.usw1

There is no explicit declaration for local provider name "aws" in module.vpc_west, so Terraform is assuming you mean to pass a configuration for "hashicorp/aws".

If you also control the child module, add a required_providers entry named "aws" with the source address "hashicorp/aws".

(and one more similar warning elsewhere)

Invalid attribute in provider configuration

  with provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/kubernetes"],
  on eks.tf line 1, in provider "kubernetes":
   1: provider "kubernetes" {

'config_path' refers to an invalid path: "/home/developer/.kube/config": stat /home/developer/.kube/config: no such file or directory

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
